    When not at the university or conducting research, I am usually spending my time enjoying a variety of video game
    from among the FPS, RPG and Simulation genres. I would list <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>,
    <em>The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</em>, <em>Rome: Total War</em>, <em>BioShock</em>,
    <em>PlayerUnknown's BattleGrounds</em>, <em>Crusader Kings II</em> and <em>Stardew Valley</em> as among the all-time greats.

    More recently, I have taken an interest in driving for the sheer enjoyment of it, and developing my programming
    language experience in the evenings. When I have finished my current course in Python, my intention
    is to undertake a series of similar courses in JavaScript and Rust.

    <p>I maintain an interest in Scotch whisky, and particularly enjoy various expressions of Ardbeg, Isle of Arran, Bunnahabhain and Bruichladdich.</p>
    <p>On a Wednesday evening or a Sunday morning, I can usually be found at the Christian church that I attend.</p>
