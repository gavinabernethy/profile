        <p>
          Most of my previous research has been conducted using Fortran 90, and I frequently
          use (and occasionally teach the use of) MATLAB, particularly for visualisation.
          However I am in the process of fully retraining in Python, which I intend as the primary
          language for my future work.
        <br> <br>
          All of my course materials and journal submissions are prepared using LaTeX.
