      <p>I grew up in Northern Ireland, originally in the countryside of County Down where I attended the very small Drumaghlis Primary School that, sadly, no longer exists.
        When I was about 11 years old, we moved to the suburbs of Newtownabbey which is a few miles to the north of Belfast,
        and I enrolled at Belfast Royal Academy in the city centre. Although this was initially a challenging move, I remain
        grateful for the friends I made and the wise and gracious example set by the teaching staff.</p>
      <p>
        My undergraduate studies took place at the University of St Andrews in Scotland from 2010-2014.
        This consisted of a balance of pure and applied mathematics,
        focusing on real and abstract analysis, measure theory and fractal geometry from the pure division,
        and a mixture of dynamical systems, scientific programming and solar magnetohydrodynamics on the applied side.
        My senior honours project was supervised by Prof Lars Olsen, on the uniform distribution of sequences.
        During 2012, I was also the treasurer of the St Andrews University Christian Union.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following a short break from studies, I undertook my doctorate in the School of Computing at Ulster University under
        the supervision of Dr Mark McCartney and Dr David Glass. This concerned the modelling and simulation of complex ecological systems,
        particularly eco-evolutionary models of the emergence of communities and meta-communities of species.
        The outcomes from these investigations can be found on my <a href="publications.html">publications</a> page.

        Shortly before defending my thesis in 2018 (in one of life's minor pleasures, I was officially awarded a doctorate on my 27th birthday), I was appointed to a lectureship at Sheffield Hallam University in Sheffield, England.
        My role in engineering mathematics is primarily to train undergraduates on our various engineering degree pathways
        (particularly Railway Engineering) in the requisite mathematical, statistical and computational techniques that such disciplines require.
        During the first two years of this appointment, I completed a PGCTHE and consequently attained Fellowship of the Higher Education Academy,
        and following my second year in the role (and profession) I was one of twenty-two members of staff across the university to receive an Inspirational Teaching Award
        on the basis of nomination by my students. As we are all well-aware, the modes of education changed drastically in March 2020, and in the autumn
        of that year I recorded almost 200 short videos for lecture series in undergraduate engineering mathematics.
        I continue to conduct research around the modelling and simulation of population dynamics on complex networks, and for the year
        2021-22 I am one of the university's Early Career Research and Innovation Fellows.
        I was progressed to a Senior Lecturer position in the summer of 2021.
